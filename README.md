# 🍎 Golden Harvesting – Predictive Model for Apple Quality Assurance

A machine learning project that leverages computer vision to evaluate apple quality based on visible defects, helping automate and enhance quality control processes in agriculture.

---

## 💡 Overview

Golden Harvesting is a predictive model designed to:

* Detect surface-level apple defects from images.
* Classify apples based on quality grade.
* Assist farmers and suppliers in automating the sorting and inspection process.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
* **OpenCV** for image processing
* **Flask / FastAPI** for backend deployment (optional)
* **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation
